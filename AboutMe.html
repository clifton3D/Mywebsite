                      <h2>I am Clifton Williams, a Mediadesigner/3D Artist apprentice, in Germany.</h2>
                      <p>I was born on Saturday the 14th of October 1989 in Lexington Missouri, USA. Lived in the States until I was about 9 years old, 
                          and we moved to Germany. Starting my bi-lingual learning curve around the same time we moved, things have never been so easy and I sometimes 
                          find myself still struggling with words.<br><br>

                            I live near Pirmasens in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. While I did move back to the States for a few years, 
                            I decided to return to live near my mother and sister. Both of which are big supporters in my life.<br><br>
                            
                            I am in a 3-year apprenticeship at 3D Schuhdesign to become a Mediadesigner. My main field of work however is in 3D Design. 
                            Currently in my last year of the apprenticeship and looking to move forward on the next step in my life.<br><br>
                            
                            I have many interests that are all over the place. From design and 3D, to gaming and writing, all the way to politics and smoking a cigar. 
                            I created this page to live out and share my work, my hopes, my dreams and future plans.
                            </p>

                          <h2>Mediadesign</h2>
                          <p>My apprenticeship of course is in Mediadesign, but at work I have learned 3D Design. I worry about what will happen once I am finished. 
                              I did learn a lot during the 1-2 days of School I have had each week, but I do not have the experience many of my classmates do.<br><br>

                                I do still enjoy working on different projects. Mostly for myself and friends. Making Logos, Websites or helping with different flyers.</p>

                              <h2>3D Design</h2>
                              <p>As you already know, this is my main field at work, and I have found a passion in creating different 3D props for my own enjoyment. 
                                  I put all my work on Artstation and various other 3D sites. Most of my work are projects for myself, 
                                  but it doesn’t stop me from sharing it with others. In the back of my mind, I would like to be discovered and have the chance to try out the 
                                  waters in Gamedesign.
                                    </p>

                                  <h2>Youtube & Gaming</h2>
                                  <p>Yes, like most in my line of work, I enjoy playing games and making Youtube content, when I am not watching other’s content.<br>
                                        The games I enjoy depend on the mood of the day. Sometimes games like Age of Empires, Crusader Kings II and Skyrim. 
                                        But also, GTA 5, Minecraft, Renaissance Kingdoms and so on.<br><br>
                                        
                                        My own created content is 3D Learning/Tutorials or just having plain fun with 3D and Minecraft. Here and there I will try other games.
                                        </p>

                                      <h2>Writing</h2>
                                      <p>I love reading stories. I love imagining my own stories as well. It all started with a browser based mmorpg called freewar.de 
                                          and later freewar.com. Of course, other than the chat, there was not much more to write unless you found a group of 
                                          people interested in story-telling. But you were able to think up your characters background and story.<br><br>

                                            This went on to fan-fiction, forum based rpgs and me working on a few books. I often do this in connection with my next point.
                                            </p>

                                          <h2>Cigars</h2>
                                          <p>I will enjoy a cigar daily. It has become something of a passion and I claim to be an enthusiast. 
                                              That being said, I just recently found the enjoyment and am by no means an expert on cigar and likely never will be. 
                                              Although, I would like to own a cigar lounge.<br><br>

                                                I do not like Cuban cigars. They usually burn uneven and I am not a fan of the taste. 
                                                My favorite of to date is from My Father the “El Centurion”.

                                              <p>In the world today, you have to inform yourself. I started this in 2011 leading up to the President elections in the USA. 
                                                  On this journey to figuring out what policies I support, which I don’t and what Ideology to follow, 
                                                  I found out a lot about myself. And a lot about the way I was raised and the way I believe God would approve of.<br><br>

                                                    I am a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment. I believe in free-speech and a libertarian world view, free of tax.
